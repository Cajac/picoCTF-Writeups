amazing shell interface, just tell them: That's Special (TM)

Start your instance to see connection details.

## Solution

### Connect to the server

Start by connecting to the server with SSH
```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/mnt/…/picoCTF/picoCTF_2023/General_Skills/Special]
└─$ ssh -p 63243 ctf-player@saturn.picoctf.net
The authenticity of host '[saturn.picoctf.net]:63243 ([13.59.203.175]:63243)' can't be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:tJ0wuU5yBvNO/FrkHmR9iY36VJClMhKV+Hq2sxqKFmg.
This key is not known by any other names.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes

ctf-player@saturn.picoctf.net's password: 
Welcome to Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS (GNU/Linux 5.19.0-1024-aws x86_64)

Special$ 
```

### Try different commands

Let's try some sample commands
```
Special$ ls
Is 
sh: 1: Is: not found
Special$ pwd
Pod 
sh: 1: Pod: not found
Special$ id
Id 
sh: 1: Id: not found
```
As said in the challenge description, the commands are spell-checked and Capitalized.

### Try to launch a real shell

Then I tried to launch a new real shell
```
Special$ bash
Why go back to an inferior shell?
Special$ sh
Why go back to an inferior shell?
Special$ csh
Why go back to an inferior shell?
Special$ zsh
Why go back to an inferior shell?
Special$ $0
I 
sh: 1: I: not found
```

Nope, not allowed or didn't work.

### Experiment with different shell syntax

Next, I followed the hint to `experiment with different shell syntax`.

I tried to `quote` commands with `'` and `"`
```
Special$ 'ls'
Also 
sh: 1: Also: not found
Special$ "ls"
Also 
sh: 1: Also: not found
```

This worked for some commands like `pwd` and `grep`
```
Special$ "pwd"
"pwd" 
/home/ctf-player

Special$ "grep"
"grep" 
Usage: grep [OPTION]... PATTERNS [FILE]...
Try 'grep --help' for more information.
```

I also tried [command substitution](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Command-Substitution.html). This also worked some what on commands like `ls`
```
Special$ $(ls)  
$(ls) 
sh: 1: blargh: not found
```
So there is a file or directory called `blargh` in the current directory (which is `/home/ctf-player`).

### Get the flag

Now we ought to be able to get the flag by grepping for anything (`.`) recursively
```
Special$ "grep" -r . *
"grep" or . * 
grep: .: Is a directory
grep: blargh: Is a directory

Special$ "grep" -"r" . *
"grep" -"r" . * 
blargh/flag.txt:picoCTF{<REDACTED>}
```

And there we have the flag.
