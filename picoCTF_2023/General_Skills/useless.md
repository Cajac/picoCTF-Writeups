Description:
There's an interesting script in the user's home directory

The work computer is running SSH. We've been given a script which performs some basic calculations, 
explore the script and find a flag.

Hostname: saturn.picoctf.net
Port:     55661
Username: picoplayer
Password: password

Hints:
(None)
```

## Solution

Start by connecting to the server with SSH
```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/picoCTF/picoCTF_2023/General_Skills/useless]

picoplayer@challenge:~$ 
```

The script should be located in our home directory so lets look for it
```
picoplayer@challenge:~$ ls -la

picoplayer@challenge:~$ cat useless

# Basic mathematical operations via command-line arguments

if [ $# != 3 ]
then
  echo "Read the code first"
else
        if [[ "$1" == "add" ]]
        then 
          sum=$(( $2 + $3 ))
          echo "The Sum is: $sum"  

        elif [[ "$1" == "sub" ]]
        then 
          sub=$(( $2 - $3 ))
          echo "The Substract is: $sub" 

        elif [[ "$1" == "div" ]]
        then 
          div=$(( $2 / $3 ))
          echo "The quotient is: $div" 

        elif [[ "$1" == "mul" ]]
        then
          mul=$(( $2 * $3 ))
          echo "The product is: $mul" 

        else
          echo "Read the manual"
         
        fi
fi
```

Hhm, no flag there. But there is an instruction to read the manual and the challenge is also tagged with `man` so lets try that
```
picoplayer@challenge:~$ man useless

useless
     useless, — This is a simple calculator script

SYNOPSIS
     useless, [add sub mul div] number1 number2

DESCRIPTION
     Use the useless, macro to make simple calulations like addition,subtraction, multiplication and division.

Examples
     ./useless add 1 2
       This will add 1 and 2 and return 3

     ./useless mul 2 3
       This will return 6 as a product of 2 and 3

     ./useless div 6 3
       This will return 2 as a quotient of 6 and 3

     ./useless sub 6 5
       This will return 1 as a remainder of substraction of 5 from 6

Ah, the flag is included at the bottom of the man page.
