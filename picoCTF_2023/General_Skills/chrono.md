I know since previously that scheduled jobs in linux is specified in the `crontab`.  
Otherwise this might require some Googling to find out...

You can list your cronjobs with `crontab -l` so lets try that
```
picoplayer@challenge:~$ crontab -l
no crontab for picoplayer
```

Hm, no joy there. The configuration files for cron are, like most other configuration, stored in the `/etc` directory so lets go there
```
picoplayer@challenge:~$ cd /etc
picoplayer@challenge:/etc$ ls -la cron*
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 43 Mar 16 02:00 crontab

cron.d:

```

Lets start by checking the `/etc/crontab`  file which also contains the flag.
```
picoplayer@challenge:/etc$ cat crontab 
# picoCTF{<REDACTED>}
```
