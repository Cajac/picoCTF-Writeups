Description:
Help us test the form by submiting the username as test and password as test!

The website running here.

Hints:
1. any redirections?
```

## Solution

Browse to the web site but before you login start DevTools in your browser (press F12) and navigate to the `Network` tab as the hint wants us to look for redirections. 

Then login with `test:test!`.

You will indeed see a number of redirections. [HTTP status codes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status) in the 3xx range are redirections.

One of the `id` parameters ends with two equal signs so they are both probably base64 encoded. The '=' is padding in base64.

Lets try to decode it to verify
```

└─$ echo "cGljb0NURntwcm94aWVzX2Fs" | base64 -d
picoCTF{proxies_al  
```

Combine the parameters and you have the flag.
