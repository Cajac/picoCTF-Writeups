## Solution

Browse to the web site but before you login start DevTools in your browser (press F12) and navigate to the `Network` tab as the hint wants us to look for redirections. 
In the `Network`tab make sure you have the `Preserve Log` option enabled.

Then login with `test:test!`.

You will indeed see a number of redirections. [HTTP status codes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status) in the 3xx range are redirections.

![Redirections when logging in](Redirections_in_the_findme_challenge.png)

One of the `id` parameters ends with two equal signs so they are both probably base64 encoded. The '=' is padding in base64.

Let's try to decode it to verify
```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/picoCTF/picoCTF_2023/Web_Explotation/findme]
└─$ echo "cGljb0NURntwcm94aWVzX2Fs" | base64 -d
picoCTF{proxies_al  
```

Combine the parameters and you have the flag.
