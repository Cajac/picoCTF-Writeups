## Solution

The challenge name and description tells us that there are [Regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) (RegEx) involved.

### Checking the web page and source code

Browsing to the web site you see:
 * A 'Valid Input' text
 * A text input field
 * A Submit button

Let's view the source of the web page and especially the `send_request` function
```javascript
	function send_request() {
		let val = document.getElementById("name").value;
		// ^p.....F!?
		fetch(`/flag?input=${val}`)
			.then(res => res.text())
			.then(res => {
				const res_json = JSON.parse(res);
				alert(res_json.flag)
				return false;
			})
		return false;
	}
```

### Analysis of the regular expression

The comment in the function suggests that the regular expression matching the input is `^p.....F!?`.

This means that the input should
1. Start with the lower letter 'p'
2. Then include any 5 characters ('.' matches any character)
3. Then be followed by an upper letter 'F'
4. Then have an optional '!'

### Getting the flag

There are lots of different input that will match the regex above and print the flag.  
These are examples of some of them:
 * picoCTF
 * picoCTF!
 * paaaaaF
 * picoCTF is fun
