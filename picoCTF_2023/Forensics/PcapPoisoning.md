## Solution

Open the PCAP-file in [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) and let's take the description more or less literally by just assuming the flag are available in plain in the packet capture.

Set a display filter of `tcp.payload contains "picoCTF"` and press Enter.

Ah, only one packet matches and the flag is indeed visible in the ASCII details of the packet.
