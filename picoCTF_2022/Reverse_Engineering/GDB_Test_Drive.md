Author: LT 'SYREAL' JONES

Description:
Can you get the flag?

Download this binary.

Here's the test drive instructions:
$ chmod +x gdbme
$ gdb gdbme
(gdb) layout asm
(gdb) break *(main+99)
(gdb) run
(gdb) jump *(main+104)

Hints:
(None)
```

## Solution

We just need to follow the given instructions.
First, make the file executable and start `gdb`
```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/picoCTF/picoCTF_2022/Reverse_Engineering/GDB_Test_Drive]
└─$ chmod +x gdbme 

┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/picoCTF/picoCTF_2022/Reverse_Engineering/GDB_Test_Drive]
└─$ gdb gdbme

```

When we issue `layout asm` we get a text based GUI-like window
```
(gdb) layout asm
```

Then we set a breakpoint on sleep and run the program
```
(gdb) break *(main+99)
(gdb) run
```

The program is now sleeping but we can force it out of the sleep by setting the instruction pointer 
to the next instruction after the sleep. This will continue the program and print the flag (not shown here).
```
(gdb) jump *(main+104)
```
