Description:
Can you get the flag?

Go to this website and see what you can discover.

Hints:
1. Is there more code than what the inspector initially shows?
```

## Solution

Browse to the web site and then right-click and select 'View page source'.
You will see the following HTML-code
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
    <title>On Includes</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
  
    <h1>On Includes</h1>
    <p>Many programming languages and other computer files have a directive, 
       often called include (sometimes copy or import), that causes the 
       contents of a second file to be inserted into the original file. These 
       included files are called copybooks or header files. They are often used
       to define the physical layout of program data, pieces of procedural code
       and/or forward declarations while promoting encapsulation and the reuse
       of code.</p>
    <br>
    <p> Source: Wikipedia on Include directive </p>
    <button type="button" onclick="greetings();">Say hello</button>
  </body>
</html>
```

There is no flag visible here, but there are two additional files to check out.

Click on the 'style.css' link to view that file
```css
body {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

/*  picoCTF{1nclu51v17y_1of2_  */
```

There is the first part of the flag as a comment.

Now go back to the HTML-source and click on 'script.js' link
```javascript
function greetings()
{
  alert("This code is in a separate file!");
}

//  f7w_2of2_df589022}
```

There is the second part of the flag as a comment.

Combine the two parts and you have the flag.
