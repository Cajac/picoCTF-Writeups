Description:
Can you get the flag?
Here's the website.

We know that the website files live in /usr/share/nginx/html/ and the flag is at /flag.txt 
but the website is filtering absolute file paths. Can you get past the filter to read the flag?

Hints:
(None))
```

## Solution

The challenge name and description suggests that this challenge will be a [directory traversal attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directory_traversal_attack).

### Browse to the web site

Browse to the web site and we get a webpage titled `Web eReader`.  
On the page there is a textbox and a `Read`-button.  
We seem to be able to read a file of our choice.

From the challenge description we know that the root of the website is at `/usr/share/nginx/html/` and the flag is at `/flag.txt`.  
Relative to the web root the flag is at `../../../../flag.txt`. Lets try to read it.

### Get the flag

Enter `../../../../flag.txt` in the textbox and press the `Read`-button and we get the flag.
