Description:
The numbers... what do they mean?

Hints:
1. The flag is in the format PICOCTF{}
```

## Solution

There are several ways to solve this challenge and here are some of them.

### CyberChef solution

We can use [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) and the `Magic` recipe to solve this.

Write the numbers before the '{' character (that is `16 9 3 15 3 20 6`) with spaces in between in the `Input` pane of CyberChef. Don't end with a space!

Click the 'Magic Wand' icon at the `Output` pane. 
If you don't get an icon, you need to type 'magic' in the `Operations` search bar, then drag and drop it to the `Recipe` and press `BAKE`.

Cyberchef recognizes the encoding as `A1Z26`.  
Unfortunately, CyberChef can't handle the '{' and '}' characters so you need to leave them out.

Then add the rest of the number in the `Input` pane (`20 8 5 14 21 13 2 5 18 19 13 1 19 15 14`).

Finally, add the `To Upper case` recipe as instructed in the hint.

You need to manually add the '{' and '}' characters before submitting the flag.

### Use an online A1Z26 decoder service

You can also use an online A1Z26 decoder service such as [Boxentriq](https://www.boxentriq.com/code-breaking/a1z26).

Add the numbers in the `Numbers` text field and you get the result in the `Letters` text field.

Again, you need to add the '{' and '}' characters before submitting the flag.

### Write a Python decoder

Alternatively, you can write a Python script to do the decoding
```python
#!/usr/bin/python

import string

ALPHABET = string.ascii_uppercase

enc_flag = "16 9 3 15 3 20 6 { 20 8 5 14 21 13 2 5 18 19 13 1 19 15 14 }".split()

flag = ''
for num in enc_flag:
    if num.isnumeric():
        flag += ALPHABET[int(num)-1]
    else:
        flag += num
print(flag)
```

Then we make sure the script is executable and run it to get the flag
```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/mnt/…/picoCTF/picoCTF_2019/Cryptography/The_Numbers]
└─$ chmod +x decode.py 

┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/mnt/…/picoCTF/picoCTF_2019/Cryptography/The_Numbers]
└─$ ./decode.py
PICOCTF{<REDACTED>}
```
