## Challenge information
```
Points: 100
Tags: picoCTF 2019, Web Exploitation
Author: ZARATEC/DANNY

Description:
Can you find the robots? 
https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/36474/ or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:36474

Hints:
1. What part of the website could tell you where the creator doesn't want you to look?
```

## Solution

The name of the challenge and the hint suggests that we should check the [robots.txt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots.txt) file.

We can use `curl` for this
```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/mnt/…/picoCTF/picoCTF_2019/Web_Exploitation/Where_are_the_robots]
└─$ curl http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:36474/robots.txt
User-agent: *
Disallow: /477ce.html
```

Ah, a web page that the site owner doesn't want search engines to include.

Lets retrieve it in silent mode (-s) and `grep` for the flag
```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/mnt/…/picoCTF/picoCTF_2019/Web_Exploitation/Where_are_the_robots]
└─$ curl -s http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:36474/477ce.html | grep -oE 'picoCTF{.*}'
picoCTF{<REDACTED>}
```

And there we have the flag.
