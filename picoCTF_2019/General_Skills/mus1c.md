After some googling I understood that this is the programming language [Rockstar](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Rockstar) with an [online emulator](https://codewithrockstar.com/online) available.

Copy and paste the source code above in the emulator and click the `Rock!`-button.  
You get the following in the output pane:
```
114
114
114
111
99
107
110
114
110
48
49
49
51
114
Program completed in 168 ms
```

This looks like ASCII-values and a short Python-script can compile the flag for us
```python
#!/usr/bin/python

ascii = [114, 114, 114, 111, 99, 107, 110, 114, 110, 48, 49, 49, 51, 114]

print(f"picoCTF{{{''.join(map(chr, ascii))}}}")
```

Finally we run the script to get the flag
```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/mnt/…/picoCTF/picoCTF_2019/General_Skills/Mus1c]
└─$ ./decode.py 
picoCTF{<REDACTED>}
```
