Description:
Sometimes you need to handle process data outside of a file.

Can you find a way to keep the output from this program and search for the flag? 

Connect to jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org 7480.

Hints:
1. Remember the flag format is picoCTF{XXXX}
2. What's a pipe? No not that kind of pipe... This kind

## Solution

Let's connect to the server with `nc` and see what we get
```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/mnt/…/picoCTF/picoCTF_2019/General_Skills/Plumbing]
└─$ nc jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org 7480 
Not a flag either
Again, I really don't think this is a flag
I don't think this is a flag either
This is defintely not a flag

```

OK, too much output. Lets `grep` for the flag
```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/mnt/…/picoCTF/picoCTF_2019/General_Skills/Plumbing]
└─$ nc jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org 7480 | grep picoCTF
picoCTF{<REDACTED>}
```

And there we have the flag.
