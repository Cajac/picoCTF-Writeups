# Writeups for picoCTF challenges

Welcome to my writeups for [picoCTF](https://play.picoctf.org/login) challenges.  
These pages are created to:
* Act as a documentation for myself
* Support my junior work colleges CTF learning
* Be a concrete project to improve my skills in markdown, git, github, etc.

## No spoilers

The solutions contains step-by-step walkthroughs but doesn't display the flags.  
Instead the flags are displayd as `picoCTF{<REDACTED>}`.
