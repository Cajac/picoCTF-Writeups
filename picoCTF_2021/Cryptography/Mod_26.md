## Challenge information
```
Points: 10

Description:
Cryptography can be easy, do you know what ROT13 is? 

cvpbPGS{arkg_gvzr_V'yy_gel_2_ebhaqf_bs_ebg13_GYpXOHqX}

Hints:
1. This can be solved online if you don't want to do it by hand!
```

## Solution

There are several ways to solve this challenge and here are some of them.

### CyberChef solution

As the hint suggested you can use an online site such as [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) and use the 'ROT13' recipe. 

Enter 'rot13' in the `Operations` search bar, then drag and drop it to the `Recipe`.  
Copy the scrambled flag to the `Input` pane and press `BAKE`.

### Use a rot13 commandline tool in Linux

There are at least two sets of packages that contains prepacked `rot13` tools:
* [hxtools](https://manpages.debian.org/testing/hxtools/hxtools.7.en.html)
* [bsdgames](https://wiki.linuxquestions.org/wiki/BSD_games)

Install them with either `sudo apt install hxtools` or `sudo apt install bsdgames`.

The tool from `hxtools` installs as `/usr/bin/rot13` and is a script that invokes the `tr` command more or less as described below.

The tool from `bsdgames` installs as `/usr/games/rot13` and calls the `caesar` tool (which is also included in the package) but with a rotation of 13.

After one of these tools have been installed you can run
```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ echo "cvpbPGS{arkg_gvzr_V'yy_gel_2_ebhaqf_bs_ebg13_GYpXOHqX}" | rot13
picoCTF{next_time_<REDACTED>}
```

### Use the tr tool in Linux

Alternatively, you can use the `tr` tool to "manually" do the decoding
```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ echo "cvpbPGS{arkg_gvzr_V'yy_gel_2_ebhaqf_bs_ebg13_GYpXOHqX}" | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'
picoCTF{next_time_<REDACTED>}
```
