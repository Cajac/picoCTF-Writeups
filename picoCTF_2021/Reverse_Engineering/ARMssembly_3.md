## Solutions

As in the previous challenges, we compile the assembly code and then emulate the program to find out what the answer is.   

First we need to install a cross compiler to compile on a non-ARM machine such as Intel x64. We do that with `sudo apt install binutils-aarch64-linux-gnu gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu`.

Then we assemble and link
```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/mnt/…/picoCTF/picoCTF_2021/Reverse_Engineering/ARMssembly_3]
└─$ aarch64-linux-gnu-as -o chall_3.o chall_3.S 

┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/mnt/…/picoCTF/picoCTF_2021/Reverse_Engineering/ARMssembly_3]
└─$ aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc -static -o chall_3 chall_3.o 

┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/mnt/…/picoCTF/picoCTF_2021/Reverse_Engineering/ARMssembly_3]
└─$ file chall_3     
chall_3: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, ARM aarch64, version 1 (GNU/Linux), statically linked, BuildID[sha1]=c5d10c1814cd2f51e391be70fdefc0aedda780b6, for GNU/Linux 3.7.0, not stripped
```

Next, we need [QEMU to emulate the execution environment](https://azeria-labs.com/arm-on-x86-qemu-user/). We install it with `sudo apt install qemu-user qemu-user-static`.

Then we can just run the program. In one of the [previous challenges](ARMssembly_0.md) I had to reboot my machine before the emulation worked.
```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/mnt/…/picoCTF/picoCTF_2021/Reverse_Engineering/ARMssembly_3]
└─$ ./chall_3 2541039191
Result: 57
```

To convert the result to hexadecimal we can use interactive python
```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/mnt/…/picoCTF/picoCTF_2021/Reverse_Engineering/ARMssembly_3]
└─$ python          
Python 3.11.4 (main, Jun  7 2023, 10:13:09) [GCC 12.2.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> hex(57)
'0x39'
>>> exit()
```

Then all we need is to create the flag according to the instructions.
