## Solution

The challenge name strongly suggests that you should access the page with the `HEAD` [HTTP request method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods).

Lets use the `curl` tool to do that
```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/mnt/…/picoCTF/picoCTF_2021/Web_Exploitation/GET_aHEAD]
└─$ curl -I http://mercury.picoctf.net:47967          
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
flag: picoCTF{<REDACTED>}
Content-type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
```

And as expected, there is the flag as a custom HTTP header.
