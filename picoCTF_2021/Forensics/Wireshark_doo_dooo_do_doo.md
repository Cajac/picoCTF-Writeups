## Solution

Open up the PCAP-file in [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/).

On easier challenges it can sometimes be worth searching for the flag in plaintext by entering a display filter of `tcp.payload contains "picoCTF"`. However, in this case it doesn't work. No packets matches.

Let's get an overview of the traffic by selecting `Protocol Hierarchy` from the `Statistics` menu.  
The traffic consists almost exclusively of HTTP-traffic.

Set a display filter of `http`. Then right-click on the first displayed packet (packet #2) and select `Follow ->` and `TCP Stream`.

Here we see the stream content displayed in the same sequence as it appeared on the network. Non-printable characters are replaced by dots. Traffic from the client to the server is colored **red**, while traffic from the server to the client is colored **blue**.

Down in the lower right corner of the window you can step through the streams by increasing or decreasing the stream number.

At stream #5 we find this content

Gur synt vf cvpbPGS{c33xno00_1_f33_h_qrnqorrs}
```

Ah, it looks like a encoded flag at the bottom.

### Decode the flag with CyberChef

To decode the flag we could use an online site such as [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) with the 'ROT13' recipe.  
Enter 'rot' in the `Operations` search bar, then drag and drop `ROT13` to the `Recipe`.  
Copy the encoded flag to the `Input` pane and press `BAKE`.

### Decode the flag with a rot13 tool

Alternatively, we can use a prepackaged `rot13` tool.  
There are at least two sets of packages that contains prepacked `rot13` tools:
* [hxtools](https://manpages.debian.org/testing/hxtools/hxtools.7.en.html)
* [bsdgames](https://wiki.linuxquestions.org/wiki/BSD_games)

Install them with either `sudo apt install hxtools` or `sudo apt install bsdgames`.

The tool from `hxtools` installs as `/usr/bin/rot13` and is a script that invokes the `tr` command more or less as described below.

The tool from `bsdgames` installs as `/usr/games/rot13` and calls the `caesar` tool (which is also included in the package) but with a rotation of 13.

After one of these tools have been installed you can run
```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/mnt/…/picoCTF/picoCTF_2021/Forensics/Wireshark_doo_dooo_do_doo]
└─$ echo "Gur synt vf cvpbPGS{c33xno00_1_f33_h_qrnqorrs}" | rot13  
The flag is picoCTF{<REDACTED>}
```

### Decode the flag with the tr command

Finally, we can use the `tr` tool to do the decoding
```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/mnt/…/picoCTF/picoCTF_2021/Forensics/Wireshark_doo_dooo_do_doo]
└─$ echo "Gur synt vf cvpbPGS{c33xno00_1_f33_h_qrnqorrs}" | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'
The flag is picoCTF{<REDACTED>}
```
