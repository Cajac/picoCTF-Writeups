Description:

We found this file. Recover the flag.
 
Hints:
1. Weird that it won't display right...
```

## Solution

### Analyse the file

Lets start with checking the file type with `file`
```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/mnt/…/picoCTF/picoCTF_2021/Forensics/tunn3l_v1s10n]
└─$ file tunn3l_v1s10n  
tunn3l_v1s10n: data
```

Hhm, not much help there. Lets check the first bytes with `xxd`
```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/mnt/…/picoCTF/picoCTF_2021/Forensics/tunn3l_v1s10n]
└─$ xxd -g 1 -l 48 tunn3l_v1s10n        
00000000: 42 4d 8e 26 2c 00 00 00 00 00 ba d0 00 00 ba d0  BM.&,...........
00000010: 00 00 6e 04 00 00 32 01 00 00 01 00 18 00 00 00  ..n...2.........
00000020: 00 00 58 26 2c 00 25 16 00 00 25 16 00 00 00 00  ..X&,.%...%.....
```

After some research (a.k.a. Googling) I find that the magic bytes `0x42 0x4D` is for a BMP image file.

Now, we need to figure out what fields in the BMP header is corrupt and need to be fixed.

### Fixing the BMP header

Fixing the header is made considerably easier with this help:
* A [specification of the file format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMP_file_format)
* At least on known good file of the same format
* A tool which can parse the headers for you such as the [010 Editor](https://www.sweetscape.com/010editor/) with its [binary templates](https://www.sweetscape.com/010editor/templates.html)

Reading from the beginning of the header the following values seems corrupt/wrong:

**The offset** on offset 0xA-0xD, should be `36 00 00 00` instead of `BA D0 00 00`.
Without additional headers the offset should be 0x36 or decimal 54.

**The header size** on offset 0xE - 0x11, should be `28 00 00 00` instead of `BA D0 00 00`.
The is standard according to the specification.

I didn't see it first but the fields actually says `BAD`...

After the changes, the headers looks like this
```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/mnt/…/picoCTF/picoCTF_2021/Forensics/tunn3l_v1s10n]
└─$ xxd -g 1 -l 48 tunn3l_v1s10n.bmp 
00000000: 42 4d 8e 26 2c 00 00 00 00 00 36 00 00 00 28 00  BM.&,.....6...(.
00000010: 00 00 6e 04 00 00 32 01 00 00 01 00 18 00 00 00  ..n...2.........
00000020: 00 00 58 26 2c 00 25 16 00 00 25 16 00 00 00 00  ..X&,.%...%.....
```

And now it is recognized as a BMP image
```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/mnt/…/picoCTF/picoCTF_2021/Forensics/tunn3l_v1s10n]
└─$ file tunn3l_v1s10n.bmp 
tunn3l_v1s10n.bmp: PC bitmap, Windows 3.x format, 1134 x 306 x 24, image size 2893400, resolution 5669 x 5669 px/m, cbSize 2893454, bits offset 54
```

The image can now be view bu only contains a fake flag (`notaflag{sorry}`).

### Get the flag

Lets try to increase the height of the image by changing offset 0x16 - 0x19 to `52 03 00 00` instead of `32 01 00 00`.
This increases the height to decimal 850 from decimal 306.

Viewing the modified image displays a real flag at the top of the image.
