Description:
Do you know how to move between directories and read files in the shell? 

Start the container, `ssh` to it, and then `ls` once connected to begin. 

Login via `ssh` as `ctf-player` with the password, `abcba9f7`
 
Hints:
1. Finding a cheatsheet for bash would be really helpful!

## Solution

This challenge is a gentle exercise in navigating around the file system on bash.

### Connect to the server

Let's connect to the server with SSH
```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/mnt/…/picoCTF/picoCTF_2021/General_Skills/Magikarp_Ground_Mission]
└─$ ssh ctf-player@venus.picoctf.net -p 52792
The authenticity of host '[venus.picoctf.net]:52792 ([3.131.124.143]:52792)' can't be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:P1f6h95BrSVnJbm2AKhphfHHGEyAeThib/rN/AwKs24.
This key is not known by any other names.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
Warning: Permanently added '[venus.picoctf.net]:52792' (ED25519) to the list of known hosts.
ctf-player@venus.picoctf.net's password: 
Welcome to Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS (GNU/Linux 5.4.0-1041-aws x86_64)

```

And check for files
```bash
ctf-player@pico-chall$ ls -la
total 16
drwxr-xr-x 1 ctf-player ctf-player 4096 Mar 16  2021 .
drwxr-xr-x 1 ctf-player ctf-player 4096 Aug 13 16:24 ..
-rw-r--r-- 1 ctf-player ctf-player   14 Mar 16  2021 1of3.flag.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 ctf-player ctf-player   56 Mar 16  2021 instructions-to-2of3.txt
```

Ah, the first part of the flag.

### Getting the first part of the flag

Let's accumulate all the flag parts in a new file `/tmp/full_flag.txt` 
```bash
ctf-player@pico-chall$ cat 1of3.flag.txt > /tmp/full_flag.txt
```

Then we follow the instructions for the middle part of the flag
```bash
ctf-player@pico-chall$ cat instructions-to-2of3.txt 
Next, go to the root of all things, more succinctly `/`

ctf-player@pico-chall$ cd /

ctf-player@pico-chall$ ls -la
total 92
drwxr-xr-x   1 root root 4096 Aug 13 16:22 .
drwxr-xr-x   1 root root 4096 Aug 13 16:22 ..
-rwxr-xr-x   1 root root    0 Aug 13 16:22 .dockerenv
-rw-r--r--   1 root root   17 Mar 16  2021 2of3.flag.txt
drwxr-xr-x   1 root root 4096 Mar 16  2021 bin
drwxr-xr-x   2 root root 4096 Apr 24  2018 boot
drwxr-xr-x   5 root root  340 Aug 13 16:22 dev
drwxr-xr-x   1 root root 4096 Aug 13 16:22 etc
drwxr-xr-x   1 root root 4096 Mar 16  2021 home
-rw-r--r--   1 root root   51 Mar 16  2021 instructions-to-3of3.txt
drwxr-xr-x   1 root root 4096 Mar 16  2021 lib
drwxr-xr-x   2 root root 4096 Feb 22  2021 lib64
drwxr-xr-x   2 root root 4096 Feb 22  2021 media
drwxr-xr-x   2 root root 4096 Feb 22  2021 mnt
drwxr-xr-x   1 root root 4096 Mar 16  2021 opt
dr-xr-xr-x 186 root root    0 Aug 13 16:22 proc
drwx------   2 root root 4096 Feb 22  2021 root
drwxr-xr-x   1 root root 4096 Aug 13 16:24 run
drwxr-xr-x   1 root root 4096 Mar 16  2021 sbin
drwxr-xr-x   2 root root 4096 Feb 22  2021 srv
dr-xr-xr-x  13 root root    0 Aug 13 16:22 sys
drwxrwxrwt   1 root root 4096 Mar 16  2021 tmp
drwxr-xr-x   1 root root 4096 Feb 22  2021 usr
drwxr-xr-x   1 root root 4096 Feb 22  2021 var
```

### Getting the middle part of the flag

Lets append the middle part to our `full_flag.txt` file
```bash
ctf-player@pico-chall$ cat 2of3.flag.txt >> /tmp/full_flag.txt
```

Then we follow the instructions for the middle part of the flag
```bash
ctf-player@pico-chall$ cat instructions-to-3of3.txt 
Lastly, ctf-player, go home... more succinctly `~`

ctf-player@pico-chall$ cd ~

ctf-player@pico-chall$ ls -la
total 32
drwxr-xr-x 1 ctf-player ctf-player 4096 Aug 13 16:24 .
drwxr-xr-x 1 root       root       4096 Mar 16  2021 ..
drwx------ 2 ctf-player ctf-player 4096 Aug 13 16:24 .cache
-rw-r--r-- 1 ctf-player ctf-player   80 Mar 16  2021 .profile
drw------- 1 ctf-player ctf-player 4096 Mar 16  2021 .ssh
-rw-r--r-- 1 ctf-player ctf-player   10 Mar 16  2021 3of3.flag.txt
drwxr-xr-x 1 ctf-player ctf-player 4096 Mar 16  2021 drop-in
```

### Getting the last part of the flag

Let's append the last part of the flag and then view the full flag
```bash
ctf-player@pico-chall$ cat 3of3.flag.txt >> /tmp/full_flag.txt
ctf-player@pico-chall$ cat /tmp/full_flag.txt 
picoCTF{xxsh_
0ut_<REDACTED>
<REDACTED>}
```

Ah, how annoying. There were newlines in the flag files.

Lets remove them with `tr`
```bash
ctf-player@pico-chall$ cat /tmp/full_flag.txt | tr -d '\n'
picoCTF{xxsh_0ut_<REDACTED>}ctf-player@pico-chall$ 
```
