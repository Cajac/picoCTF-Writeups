Description:
Using a Secure Shell (SSH) is going to be pretty important.
Can you ssh as ctf-player to titan.picoctf.net at port 64614 to get the flag?

You'll also need the password 1ad5be0d. If asked, accept the fingerprint with yes.

If your device doesn't have a shell, you can use: https://webshell.picoctf.org
If you're not sure what a shell is, check out our Primer: https://primer.picoctf.com/#_the_shell

Hints:
1. https://linux.die.net/man/1/ssh
2. You can try logging in 'as' someone with <user>@titan.picoctf.net
3. How could you specify the port?
4. Remember, passwords are hidden when typed into the shell

## Solution

We connect with SSH like this:
```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/mnt/…/picoCTF/picoCTF_2024/General_Skills/Super_SSH]
└─$ ssh -p 50400 ctf-player@titan.picoctf.net
The authenticity of host '[titan.picoctf.net]:50400 ([3.139.174.234]:50400)' can't be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:4S9EbTSSRZm32I+cdM5TyzthpQryv5kudRP9PIKT7XQ.
This host key is known by the following other names/addresses:
    ~/.ssh/known_hosts:94: [hashed name]
    ~/.ssh/known_hosts:95: [hashed name]
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
Warning: Permanently added '[titan.picoctf.net]:50400' (ED25519) to the list of known hosts.
ctf-player@titan.picoctf.net's password: 
Welcome ctf-player, here's your flag: picoCTF{<REDACTED>}
Connection to titan.picoctf.net closed.
```
And there we have the flag.
